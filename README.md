# OREGON

This is an implementation of the game [Oregon](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/341393/oregon), designed by Reiner Knizia, published on the book _"Blazing Aces!"_ , by FRED distribution and Convivium Publications.

### Rules

Cards are shuffled. Five cards are laid out face-up in a row. One card after another is drawn from the deck . Add each card onto an old card or start a new row. All new cards may only be played on the last row. When all the cards are used up, the points for the poker combinations in each row are scored. The more points the better.

### Implementation Details

Uses React, Typescript and works as a single page application. Uses Vite for development experience.
